Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation

Overview

    This project aims to develop an automated deep learning pipeline for 3D brain tumor detection, segmentation, and visualization using MRI scans. The approach leverages advanced 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate classification and segmentation, ensuring precise tumor localization and analysis.

Objectives

    Detect brain tumors from 3D MRI scans using deep learning.

    Segment tumors to identify their exact size, shape, and location.

    Provide interactive 3D visualizations for better interpretability by doctors.

    Optimize computational efficiency by using state-of-the-art models.

Workflow

    Data Acquisition: Collect MRI scans in DICOM or NIfTI format.

    Preprocessing: Apply noise reduction, intensity normalization, and image resizing.

    Tumor Detection: Use 3D CNNs (ResNet-3D or EfficientNet-3D) to classify tumor presence.

    Segmentation: Apply 3D U-Net or V-Net for voxel-level tumor segmentation.

    3D Reconstruction: Utilize techniques like VoxelMorph or PointNet for visualization.

    Visualization: Generate interactive 3D images using Matplotlib, Mayavi, or Plotly.

    Evaluation: Measure accuracy using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and IoU.

Deep Learning Models Used

    ResNet-3D / EfficientNet-3D (Tumor Classification) - CNN-based models for detecting tumors.

    3D U-Net / V-Net (Segmentation) - Extract tumor regions precisely.

    VoxelMorph / PointNet (3D Reconstruction) - Create 3D tumor representations.

Research Gap Addressed

    Most Transformer-based methods for brain tumor segmentation focus on 2D MRI slices, missing crucial 3D volumetric details and requiring high computational resources. Our project directly works with full 3D MRI volumes, preserving spatial information while leveraging CNNs to achieve high accuracy with lower computational cost.

Expected Outcome

    More accurate tumor segmentation with 3D volumetric analysis.

    Better visualization for doctors to interactively explore the tumor structure.

    A deep learning pipeline that can be integrated into medical imaging workflows.

Next Steps

    Collect and preprocess MRI datasets.

    Train the 3D CNN models for tumor detection.

    Develop the segmentation pipeline using 3D U-Net.

    Integrate visualization tools for interactive 3D analysis.

    Evaluate performance and refine the model.
